# memos

Welcome to your new memos project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with memos, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd memos/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## Customize the frontend to use React

## Candid UI

The Candid UI is pre-packaged with dfx, so there is no additional install.

You can test your actor methods locally with Candid UI by updating the networks.local.bind value in dfx.json to the URL below. However, this can only be changed after running the *dfx start* command and before running the *dfx deploy* command. Ensure that the change does not get commited to Git.
- 127.0.0.1:8000/candid?canisterId=[Candid UI Canister Id]
- Example: 127.0.0.1:8000/candid?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai

To get the Candid UI canister Id, run this command:
```
dfx canister id __Candid_UI
```

After deploying your canisters, you will be able to open the Candid UI with the following URL:
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=[Candid UI Canister Id]&id=[Your Canister Id]
- Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai

To get your canister Id, run this command:
```
dfx canister id [your canister name from dfx.json]
```

For more information see: https://smartcontracts.org/docs/candid-guide/candid-howto.html.

### Troubleshooting

If you try to run the *dfx start* command with the Candid UI URL in dfx.json, you will get the following error message in your terminal:
- thread 'main' panicked at 'could not get socket_addr: invalid port value', src/dfx/src/commands/start.rs:264:18

If this happens, simply change the URL back to the default value:
- 127.0.0.1:8000
